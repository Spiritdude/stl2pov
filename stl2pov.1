.TH stl2pov 1 "2018-12-12" "version 2.5.1" ""
.SH NAME
stl2pov \- converts an STL file to a povray mesh
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B stl2pov
.RB [ -s ]
.RB [ -e 
.IR distance ]
.RB [ -n 
.IR name ]
.I filename.stl 
.RI > outfile.inc
.SH DESCRIPTION
This program reads an STL (Standard Triangulation Language) file (both in
binary and ASCII format) and
extracts the vertex data. From these vertices it generates a mesh object
suitable for rendering with the
.BR povray (1)
raytracer, and writes it to the standard output. This manual covers version
2.5.0, released on 2011-06-22.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -s
Generate smooth triangles instead of normal triangles. See the 
.BR povray (1)
documentation for details on smooth triangles. If the STL file has
relatively few triangles, the generated image can look faceted. Using this
option can give a smoother rendered image. Although the program tries to
avoid it, using this option may introduce small visual artifacts.
.TP
.BI -e dist
Set the maximum distance between two points that are assumed to
coincide. In previous versions this was fixed at 0.01 units, which is
still the default, but you can change it now.
.TP
.BI -n name
Set the name for the resulting mesh 'm_'+name, otherwise the name of the STL solid declaration will be used.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
The program will abort if one of the following fatal errors is detected:
.TP
.BI "Could not open " "name" .
The program tried to open the file
.I name
using
.BR fopen (3)
but failed. The program cannot continue because it cannot read the input file.
.TP
.BI "Could not determine the size of " "name" .
The program tried to determine the size of the file
.I name
with 
.BR fseek (3)
and 
.BR ftell (3)
but failed. The program cannot continue because it doesn't know how much
memory to allocate for the file.
.TP
.BI "Could not allocate " "num" " bytes of memory for " "name" .
The program tried to allocate memory with
.BR malloc (3)
but failed. The program cannot continue because it cannot read the data
file into memory.
.TP
.BI "Could not read " "name" .
The program tried to read the file
.I name
with
.BR fread (3)
but this failed. The program cannot continue because it cannot read the
input file.
.TP
.BI "Reading vertex[" "num" "] failed at """ "string"  """."
The progam, using
.BR strtod (3), 
expected a floating point number but got
.I string 
instead.
.TP
.BI "Reading normal[" "num" "] failed at """ "string"  """."
The progam, using
.BR strtod (3), 
expected a floating point number but got
.I string 
instead.
.P
The following warnings do not abort the program, they just point out some
minor problems with the command-line.
.TP
.BI "Unrecognized option """ "string" """ ignored."
The program saw an option that it didn't recognize, and ignored it.
.TP
.BI "Unreadable distance """ "string" """ ignored."
The program could not parse the 
.I distance
argument to the
.B -s
option.

.SH BUGS
Using the smoothing option may sometimes result in visual artefacts on the
rendered pictures. Setting the allowed distance between coinciding points
too large will produce unwanted results.
